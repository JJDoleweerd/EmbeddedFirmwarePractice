# EmbeddedFirmwarePractice
All drivers that have been developed for the purpose of practicing and learning firmware. 
This will be documentation of my journey into firmware development. This will consist of tutorial projects and practice projects.
Languages Used: Assembly, C, C++

Gpio Assembly Tutorial Project: A simple project to get a basic understanding of assembly programming and the differences between driver development in C and assembly. Next Steps: Write an identical driver for the Nucleo STM32F401RE board and run on the physical board. This will be good practice at reading datasheets and reaffirming current assembly knowledge. 

Timer Delay Tutorial Project: A C based project designed for the Nucleo STM32F411RE board. Toggles an LED on/off every second.

Timer Counter Project: Built in C to toggle an LED ON/OFF every 5 button presses of the embedded button on the board. Then replicated and successfully run on the Nucleo-STM32F401RE board. A delay could be useful to prevent accidental double clicks.
